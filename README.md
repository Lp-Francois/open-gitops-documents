## About OpenGitOps

OpenGitOps is a [CNCF Sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) for lasting programs, documents and code from the [GitOps Working Group](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group).

## About the GitOps Working Group

The GitOps Working Group is a WG under the [CNCF App Delivery TAG](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery), with a focus to clearly define a vendor-neutral, principle-led meaning of GitOps. This will establish a foundation for interoperability between tools, conformance, and certification.
It is an open public working group welcoming anyone who would like to join and help.
See [How to Get Involved](https://github.com/gitops-working-group/gitops-working-group/blob/main/README.md#how-to-get-involved).
